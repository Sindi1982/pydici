Some words on expense workflow. Pydici used to use a fully customisable workflow
with the help of django_workflows module. It was discontinued. And after 10 years of used
the full power of a customisable workflow has never been used. The only change so far was the
addition of the controled state. Moreover, such a customisable workflow leads to some significant
drawbacks: poor performance, UI cumbersome due to generic approach and some functional limitation.
So the decision was to change this powerful but somewhat useless to a simple harcoded stupid workflow.
It rely on 6 states:
- requested: the first and starting state of any expense.
- validated: once review by user manager
- rejected: if any reviewer do not validate expense. This is a terminal state
- needs information: self explanatory, that's when user needs to provide missing info
- controled: second level review by administrative staff. This can be a terminal state if no payment is needed (ex. corp card)
- paid: expense has been paid to user (and linked to a payment). This is a terminal state

Five features controls permissions around this simple workflow: (a superuser bypass all controls)
- expense_administrator: can do anything
- expense_subsidiary_administrator: can do anything on his subsidiary except for its own expense
- expense_manager: can validate requested expense of his team
- expense_paymaster: can control expense create expense payment
- expense_requester: can create new expense
